I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

I am not a farmer, but as an educated consumer I'm worried about the lack of science based policy which can have incredibly negative effects on our food supply.  I'm concerned about the rampant fear-mongering that is allowed to continue by groups like US Right To Know and the Organic Consumer's Association.  I've seen women in the produce department walk away from safe, conventionally grown produce because they were afraid it was ""GMO"".  I'm VERY concerned that the US Government isn't stepping in on these glyphosate cancer lawsuits and allowing California's dirty jury pool - already primed for a guilty verdict by their ridiculous labeling of almost all products as carcinogenic - to give a veneer of legitimacy to the glyphosate fear.

America's farmers are incredible stewards of the land and should be allowed to continue to improve their lands performance and sustainability with safe inputs with the evidence of safety behind them.

Thank you,

C Roche

In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA's) proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

I am not a farmer, but I understand how important this tool is for farmers to use in managing weed growth, improving crop yields and and helping support conservation-based practices.

EPA has done a number of evaluations for the use of glyphosate and I have never heard of any findings that would be an issue.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

In addition, glyphosate is also beneficial in world agriculture. Its use helps struggling farm economies by quickly controlling and removing invasive species without the hours of back breaking labor requirements. Glyphosate use by label is effective and safe and would have a worldwide detrimental impact if removed from agricultural production. Please do not defer to ill informed and agenda driven parties in removing this valuable and useful product from American agriculture.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.
As a private licensed applicator, my experience shows that glyphosate is easier to mix and therefore there is less exposure than when we used to have to use several different products.  One application is all we need on our alfalfa to kill grasses like foxtail and cheatgrass as well as the broadleaf like canada and bull thistle. Before we had to use two different tank mixtures and spray same acres twice and if we were also needing to kill aphids and spider mites it required a third spraying.  Glyphosate allows us to make one mix and one trip across the field.  It also allows us to spray alfalfa and silage corn with the same mixture.  Cost saving, time saving, and clean crop land and weed free hay is possible now with glyphosate.  Also there is not drift or runoff or residual impacts to surrounding crops and pastures. 
In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

We are producers of tree fruits and wine grapes here in CO and though our crops are not ""glyphosate ready"" it is still our most important single product for weed control in managing herbicide strips in the orchard and vineyards.  To lose an effective herbicide program has the potential of taking us back to the tillage option increasing erosion, soil compaction and insect and rodent pressures as well as increased fuel consumption.  We use an array of weed control materials but glyphosate is an important rotation tool helping us minimize the rate of resistance development to any single material.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing in support of the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review which documents that glyphosate is beneficial to agriculture. 

Most farmers in my state use glyphosate in their operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer's daughter and an agricultural industry employee, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

From personal experience, I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a former farm kid working with my dad on our cotton, wheat, and alfalfa farm in Arizona, I can tell you that we used glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. We could not have had the productive and amazing cotton yields we had without this technology. Let me explain. 

Always careful about reading label instructions on use, my dad tells the story of how using a Herbie (hand-held devise for applying with a nozzle spraying out about 8 to 10 feet in front) he would spray the Glyphosate while walking through the cotton fields after the cotton was too tall for the tractor-pulled cultivator. For years he'd do this. He was confident in the safety and practicality of this technology. He's a healthy and robust 81-year-old and celebrates that this technology was available for us. And prays that it will continue to be available for use.

My family firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for Arizona and American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

Without glyphosate as a tool, our farm would find it nearly impossible to exist.

The hysteria that is causes cancer is unfounded. In the test study, the greatest concentration of glyphosate found was 51.4 parts per billion in one
of 20 wines sampled. Assuming the greatest value reported, 51.4 ppb, is correct, a 125-
pound adult would have to consume 308 gallons of wine per day, every day for life to
reach the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s glyphosate exposure limit for humans. To put 308 gallons into context, that would be more than a bottle of wine every minute, for life, without sleeping. So think about that!

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer and homeowner, I can tell you it has been beneficial to us with our lawn and also the farming operation and has been for years. Have never heard of any issue with it as to a person or animal's health. Compared to the option of not having it hate to think of the cost to the American Farmer of having to use higher cost, limited herbicides and also the increase it will bring in tillage. Tractor use will have to increase for tillage will have to increase and then we have more issues there.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim 6registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support, and perhaps bolster, the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review decision on glyphosate, specifically its comments on the IARC.

In your draft, under the section addressing the IARC claims, you list several government bodies who determined that glyphosate is safe when used properly.  This infographic from the genetic literacy project has several more, including different branches of the WHO: https://geneticliteracyproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GlyphosateInfographic_GLP-1.pdf  

The graphic also amusingly notes that the ""IARC placed glyphosate in its hazard (not risk, the distinction is important) category Group 2A: probably carcinogenic to humans along with red meat, hot beverages, and working as a barber.  

Less amusing is the fact that many lawyers (and states), used the IARC's decision to attack glyphosate, claiming in several TV ads that the ""WHO"" declared that glypohosate is a probable human carcinogen.  The infographic shows that this is a deceptive conflation.  The IARC is only one branch of the WHO, and three more branches say it is safe.       

The IARC's conclusions are suspect.  Based on this Reuter's article, it looks like they manipulated their data to reach a predetermined conclusion: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/who-iarc-glyphosate/.   

At least one of the IARC's science advisors had a conflict of interest.  https://www.science20.com/david_zaruk/is_chris_portier_the_andrew_wakefield_of_pesticides-227402

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As an employee of Monsanto and now Bayer Crop Science, I am very confident in the use of glyphosate in farming operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.  

I spent much of my 35 year career working in the development, technical, and regulatory support of the glyphosate molecule.  It has been one of the greatest inventions in ag history and it has improved efficiency, economics, and environmental benefits to all of agriculture.  Based on my experience, i have full confidence in the technology.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

Many farmers, including myself, have used glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. Glyphosate is extremely safe to use; this has been documented in several studies.  Please do not allow the opinions of activist organizations, that are looking to destroy American agriculture, sway your decision and opinion of this highly studied, effective and safe product.  Do not tie our hands from utilizing technology that allows us to be more sustainable through the increased use of no- or limited- till practices.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing in firm support of being able to continue using glyphosate to control weeds. Our farm is 100% no-till, both corn and soybeans. Yields have been slowly increasing over the past 8 seasons, due in part, to avoiding tillage which has created a more permeable soil structure which in turn increases water and nutrient holding capacity. 

Without the use of glyphosate, soil-erosive tillage practices would be the only other cost effective option.

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I've been using glyphos personally for years, and believe - as my commercial applicators have told me - that it is inactivated by soil:  it is only effective against actively growing plants.  I don't hesitate for a second to handle it.

We all know that there is a positive correlation between contact with almost any material and cancer.  But....

I use glyphos annually in my continuous strategy of the management of several perennial vegetation species.  I would be crippled without it.  

It would take a ""preponderance of evidence"" to convince me that it is unsafe for humans.  I've not seen that evidence.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that glyphosate is very important to my farm.  It has allowed me to transition from full tillage cultivation practices to continuous no-till.  This change is resulting in lower soil losses due to erosion, higher carbon levels in the soil, better soil health and higher 
 crop productivity.  I don't see a way I could continue no-tillage practices without glyphosate.  I consider it to be one of the most significant agricultural technology developments in history.  Glyphosate makes it possible for me to be a better farmer.

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

Dear sir:

I have been involved in agriculture, in some form, my entire life. I hand chopped cotton and corn as a youth. I just wished that we had some herbicides then. The people of today seemed to have forgotten those days, if they ever experienced them. Most only know the food comes from the grocery and that there is plenty of it there. Glyphosate has been a major part of that plentiful supply of foods.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

As a conservation district employee and a farmer, glyphosate is an important tool to assist in no till farming and to allow for cover cropping and other conservation practices.  While it is important to minimize the use of herbicides and pesticides, and utilize cultural practices, we do not currently have other options to meet the nutrient and sediment reduction goals of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL without some use of herbicides like glyphosate.  Science is always moving forward, and new technologies may appear, but despite its drawbacks, glyphosate still needs to be a tool available to farmers to help enable conservation minded farming.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.
I feel that the benefits outweigh the risks involved and when used as labeled it is safe. Until technology advances to provide a replacement glysophate is necessary for agriculture to produce crops for us and the world.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

This is a very beneficial herbicide that has been unfairly and unscientifically demonized.  We need it in our arsenal of herbicides as weed control continues to be more difficult.

In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

 Roundup is my best choice for weed control under most circumstances. It does a great job and it would be a giant step backward to outlaw it. Like any other chemical it has to be applied properly. please don't get rid of such an effective tool in my operation.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

I have been farming since 1979 and the chemicals that were used at that time were far more harmful to the environment and humans that glyphosate. These older chemicals burned and stunted the soybeans for several weeks after application.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

We live and farm in the Chesapeake watershed, we have been using continuous notil in excess of 20 years.  This has cut our soil and nutrient loss from erosion to almost nothing, even last year with all the rain continues notil allows organic matter to accumulate on our fields protecting the soil from erosion, preventing our soil and nutrients from washing into streams and rivers ending up in the Chesapeake Bay. Glyphosate in an important part of our continuous notil, without glyphosate we will not get the weed control needed to continue our notil farming.
I support the EPA""s belief that glyphosate is necessary to American agriculture.  Thank you for using sound science in your assessment

In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

With the use of glyphosate farmers have expanded, and can continue to expand, no-till cropping systems from corn to hemp.  This in turn greatly lowers the amount of soil erosion in highly erodible sandy loam soils like those found in Rhode Island, while continuing to be able to capture greater amounts of carbon.  In addition, the use of glyphosate eliminates the need for much harsher chemicals for weed control.  Glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture.  As the President of Rhode Island Farm Bureau, and a farmer myself, we ask that the agency continue their thoughtful and fair evaluation of its importance to farmers.

I am writing to thank the EPA for their support of the use of glyphosate. It is an important part of continuous notil.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

Personal note :
Back in the late '70's early '80's I personally sprayed lots of ""ROUNDUP' (glyphosate) here on our farm to control weeds, we had at that time more weeds than crops and most of the spray I used a hand held sprayer on, I later graduated to one on the back of the 4 wheeler or in the gator.  I observed the standard rules and was careful I was not spraying into the wind, covering my arms/hands and being very careful in the mixing of it.  I am now 80 and have observed NO ADVERSE REACTIONS NOR DO I EXPECT TO.  I LOVE SEEING ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO SEE A QUICK BUCK (MOST OF ALL THE LAWYERS) LINE UP CLAIMING THEY WERE HARMED BY IT.  NOT SURE IF THEY DRANK IT BUT IT SURE SEEMS FISHY TO ME.  I Have also used Tordon, 2-4DAmine by the gallons also to no adverse problems,  I now only use mostly 2-4D on the broadleaf in the grass fields, and Tordon on the Knapweed along the edges.  We do still use a bit of the Roundup but nothing like we used to neither my husband nor myself feel it deserves the reputation it has.  It is definitely needed on many of the crops and folks seem to love eating so will probably be needed for quite some time.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that many in my profession use glyphosate in our operations to manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge to farmers of these crops by reducing crop quality and reducing farm productivity and profitability. In addition, making glyphosate unavailable would unquestionably compromise the rapid growth of conservation-based no-till soil practices.

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.

I am writing to support the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed interim registration review that finds glyphosate is beneficial to American agriculture.

As a farmer, I can tell you that on our farm we use glyphosate in our operations to safely manage weed growth, improve crop yield and productivity and help support conservation-based practices. In 2019, according to USDA, 95% of cotton acres, 94% of soybean acres and 89% of corn acres planted were herbicide-tolerant crops. The loss of glyphosate would present a significant challenge on our farm and would reduce our productivity and profitability. While we are firmly committed to no-till crop production, the loss of glyphosate would probably force us to use some tillage to control perennial weeds.  Even occasional tillage will necessarily reduce the conservation benefits of a primarily no-till system. 

I firmly support the agency’s assessment that glyphosate is a beneficial tool for American agriculture and urge the agency to continue to use sound science in its evaluation of glyphosate’s importance to farmers.
