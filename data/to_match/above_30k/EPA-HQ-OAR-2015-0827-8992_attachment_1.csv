Meanwhile the rest of us care no matter where we are, because we are human beings seeing the ruin and destruction of fellow human beings and of the beautiful, irreplaceable planet we live on. We care about what happens in places we are not and in times to come when we will not be.

We knew this would happen, and we didn’t care. Now is the time to say it as loudly as possible: Harvey is what climate change looks like……..Harvey is what climate change looks like in a world that has decided, over and over, that it doesn’t want to take climate change seriously. “Climate change is making rainstorms everywhere worse, but particularly on the Gulf Coast. Since the 1950s, Houston has seen a 167 percent increase in the frequency of the most intense downpours. Climate scientist Kevin Trenberth thinks that as much as 30 percent of the rainfall from Harvey is attributable to human-caused global warming. That means Harvey is a storm decades in the making. 'A warmer atmosphere enhances evaporation rates and increases the carrying capacity of rainstorms. Harvey drew its energy from a warmer-than-usual Gulf of Mexico, which will only grow warmer in the decades to come. At its peak…..Harvey produced rainfall rates exceeding six inches per hour in Houston, and its multi-day rainfall total …close to [or more]….. maximum expected for anywhere in the United States. “Weather patterns…..getting “stuck” more often, boosting the chances that a storm like Harvey would stall out. Some scientists have linked this to melting Arctic sea ice, which reduces the strength of the polar jet stream and weakens atmospheric steering currents that can otherwise dip down and"

Hurricane Harvey was stronger and dumped more rain than a usual hurricane because the Gulf waters are warmer than they have ever been this summer.

We have outdated trains and a power grid fueled by coal, oil and gas. Fracking has turned Oklahoma into a MAJOR earthquake zone in just a few years. We HAVE to make the leap toward supporting wind and solar energy as our main sources for energy NOW. Jobs lost in old fossil fuel industries will be replaced with BETTER jobs in the renewable industries AND be safer for workers than coal mining, fracking or oil drilling. Pipeline spills will no longer threaten our water and make land unusable. Fossil fuels are ruining our air, water, and soil... not just for humans, but for all of Earth's creatures.

Desmond,Doulatram,OAKLAND,CA,94608,,"A Care2 petition to the EPA signed by 46,784 supporters US I am writing to express my concern on the relative bias the media has undertaken not addressing climate change as a major issue in light of Hurricane Harvey.The Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner has indicated that “climate change impacts severely limits the range of human rights by people throughout the world, including the rights to life, water and sanitation, food, health, housing, self determination, culture and development.” The fact that this media censorship on climate change has gotten out of control due to the negative politicizing of environmental concerns pertaining to 
humanitarian survival speaks for itself. As an American who underwent training and was certified by the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), it is extremely important to mainstream a climate change lens due to a changing climate for better Disaster Risk Preparedness, Recovery, and Response. There's a thing called Disaster Preparedness, Early Response, and Recovery by being Proactive due to Climate Change Impacts and these early warning systems and disaster preparedness can ensure a better cushion effect to reduce and mitigate climate impacts for lesser damage to avoid further disasters.Sadly, these early response systems and programs due were rescinded to the view of Climate Change being a hoax.

It is willful ignorance to undo the progress that has been made since the EPA was established in 1970 by, yes, a Republican president. And contrary to the effort to cling to limited petroleum resources, the rest of the world is making advances in renewable energy that will soon leave the U.S. far behind, reviled for polluting our shared environment, and a far cry from “Great again.” The gas and coal industries are nearly as extinct as the mesozoic fauna that died to create the hydrocarbon deposits they’re based on – and the sooner they come to an end, the better."

Last year my husband-- who was never a smoker--died of emphysema, partly caused by the lung-damaging smog in Burbank, MOSTLY CAUSED BY AUTOMOBILE EMISSIONS. Children often were told to stay indoors in those years. Now the smog is somewhat better, but without continuing to move towards cleaner cars and reining in the fossil fuel industry, our country's air quality will continue to deteriorate.

Nichole,Melka,Cicero,IL,60804,,"US Limit global warming pollution which increases climate related weather escalation. I have a degree in science so this can easily explained. First, it is true the earth goes through cycles of natural warm and cool spells without human interferences. However, these natural warming and cooling spells become greater as humans interfere with those cycles. Via use of more vehicles for longer periods of time, when cars need to be 'jumped' by another car to run, company factories wastes, removal of rural lands, deforestation etc. It may seem hard to believe but remember it's does not take much to throw off your own bodies stability. It doesn't take much to throw off the planets stability either. Taking preventative action before climate problems become permanent and or extreme is not foolish it's actually quite smart. Please keep emitted greenhouse gases limited for climate protection."

marian,feldman,north Potomac,MD,20878,,"A Care2 petition to the EPA signed by 46,784 supporters US There is scientific information we can avail ourselves of, but this administration refuses to pay attention to the increasing problems and expenses coming our way due to climate change, lack of zoning, fracking etc. We cannot afford to go backwards. We can only imagine what these people are going through, and will continue to experience. There are people from Katrina and Rita and Gustov who are still dealing with their problems with their loses."

Vernon,Greenland,Caldwell,ID,83605,,"US There will come a time when the storms will damage more then a couple of states at a time. Unless our government gets back on climate change wagon again we can look forward to an storm that will cover the whole east coast or the whole gulf coast, an god forbid a storm that covers both at once. With 50+ years of science on this matter, there should be no question we need to stop killing our home"

Marilyn,Mueller,Alpharetta,GA,,,"A Care2 petition to the EPA signed by 46,784 supporters 30004-7415 US This GOP Congress and Administration only care about enriching themselves, protecting their donors and power. They don't care about you or this country."

Jim,Steitz,Gatlinburg,TN,37738,,"US This horrible disaster’s intensity was unequivocally, indisputably fueled by the super-hot waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which gave so much kinetic energy and moisture to the final days of this hurricane. Trump’s enshrinement of ignorance, denial, and venality as official government policy toward our fragile climate is an irrevocable prescription for a century full of Hurricane Harveys, battering America in unendurable succession through the century. If you want our children to survive and enjoy a habitable climate, and do not want Houston’s 2017 to become the ‘new normal’ for our children, you must stop Trump’s suicidal attack on our climate and deranged promotion of the fossil fuels causing these disasters."
Maria,Roberts,Park City,UT,84098,,"US This hurricane is just the beginning. The GOP nixes climate change by allowing the buffoon in the White House to go back to polluting our air and harming the environment and wildlife.

Iris,Roberts,NEWRY,ME,4261,,"US This is a critical situation. The science is 'out there,' the big oil companies and the Republicans have countered the science in ways that benefit profits and political power. The well-being the planet is crucial if we as a species are going to survive. This strong truth is becoming more apparent with time. It is time to take power AWAY from big money and powerful politicians. The problem is that our elections are not fair anymore, either. Until this situation is corrected and our elections truly represent the people's wishes, our lives and the planet will be in peril. Oh, and paper ballots, please, counted by committees of Swiss citizens!!!"
