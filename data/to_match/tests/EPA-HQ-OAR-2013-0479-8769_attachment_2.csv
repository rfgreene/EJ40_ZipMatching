Jerry,Baguss,52076,"I  am retired and any savings that I had were used up on medical expenses so my wife and I live on my Social Security check. This means that every penny counts.

Although it is not a lot, using Ethanol gas saves me ten or fifteen cents per gallon when filling my car. Saving ten cents here and another ten cents somewhere else adds up for people living on fixed incomes.","While I know that the country needs to get a handle on the budget, it's hard for people like myself to understand why our elected officials are always trying to curb projects that help us, and at the same time approving expensive programs that only aide the wealthy?

Also, why not demand that contractors stop inflating costs as far as wages and materials go when doing government work? We all know that prices are automatically inflated if it is government customers whether state or federal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lyndall,Tunnell,52001,"We own about 200 acres of farm ground and raise corn and soybeans.  The income from our farm is enhanced by the higher prices resulting from higher demand, driven in part by renewable energy needs.

Before ethanol, we had many years of selling corn for $1.80 per bushel.  We would not welcome back those days.

Additionally, in Iowa, each time we fill our vehicles with fuel, we select a grade of gasoline with 10% ethanol.","We would just as soon see the direct farm payments disappear to help balance the budget.  They just increase rents and price of land and therefore do nothing to help the farmer be profitable.  Meanwhile, farmers face severe ridicule for receiving these payments at the expense of taxpayers.  A slow phasing out would make the most sense, say 10% a year.

We would rather see money go toward bolstering crop insurance to make it solid (with or without government subsidy).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mark,Knudtson,52155,"I have personally invested in several ethanol plants, with a major component of my decision based upon knowing the renewable fuel standard would help ensure demand and industry growth.  A reduction of the renewable fuel standard is simply a betrayal of trust, since there is no shortage of grain or economic hardship caused by it. The law is simply acting as intended and should be considered a great American success story, considering what it has done for rural America. Be assured that if it is reduced, it will be long time before I am willing to invest based on government actions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mark,Hart,52402,"My son is in school to study how to work with renewable energy, specifically wind energy, but with an interest in solar energy as well. He is eager to work with and on the next generation of renewable energy technology, and it is my hope that he enjoys a long and fruitful career. It is his strong hope to earn a living to support his family, and to be a productive citizen of Iowa. If the forces that oppose renewable energy have their way, Iowa and the nation will lose the skills, passion, and creativity of the next generation of workers who wish to produce clean, affordable energy. I can only hope that our leaders will support renewable energy -- we need exactly this sort of job, and our nation needs this sort of clean energy now more than ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sherman,Needham,50636,"As a farmer, renewable energy offers additional markets for corn. This helps my income, especially when we have an excess of corn being produced as we do now. Many of my neighbors feed the corn by product from extracting the ethnol from corn. This feed is of value to them since it is available at a lower cost than whole corn.
The Renewable Fuels Standard should be increased not decreased.
As a nation, we need to continue to provide additional sources of energy to supplement our oil reserves for economic and environmental considerations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Harold,Schmidt,52339,"Our domestic supplies of energy are going up because of new technologies in oil production and the implementation of value added processes,like the creation of ethanol,using a variety of organic products that are being produced in abundance in this country. It is fairly simple, we process products that are created domestically, add value to them by creating ethanol and bio diesel while providing high quality feed products to the meat production industry at very competitive prices. We take something that americans poduce, create something that americans need 
and support our domestic economy. The domestic economy desperately needs his healthy sector to prosper, the world energy situation is no more certain than it has ever been and our money stays in the US allowing other americans to prosper because of this sound energy policy.","Domestic energy production of all kinds is essential to future prosperity, ethanol is a proven,fully developed industry that is achieving new levels of efficiency and adds to the health of our economy and the security of our nation.

I look forward to the day when my car's fuel can come 100% from a renewable resource like corn and soybeans. Unlike the oil of today, corn and soybeans do not need to grow overseas and we do not have to battle in a global economy to secure them, and there is no danger of it running out or having long-term negative effects on the environment through the extraction process. I will continue to prefer ethanol in my car for a long time coming, however, if the price becomes the same or more than regular fuel, then economics will win because I will need to consider my own savings over the industry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
john,tuthill,52742,"The real story here in my opinion is that we are on the very brink of getting people, our culture, to embrace sustainability via renewable fuels.  The average guy is beginning to understand that renewable fuels, whether it's ethanol in your gas tank or biomass for electricity generation, is going to ensure an adequate supply of electricity and fuel, along with clean air, drinkable water and a smaller carbon footprint.  In addition, the production of renewable fuels has had a huge ripple effect on our ag economy in Iowa.  Coming out of the disastrous flood years of late 2000's, the heartland has experienced a significant rebound in our economy, thanks to commodity prices.  It is this kind of economic good times that will foster and promote an acceptance of environmental stewardship, not the opposite. Therefore I believe as a society we can ill-afford to pull the plug on a program that is one of the foundation stone of environmental protection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Larry,Shinn,50701,"Personally I would have a tough time identifying the impact that renewable energy is affecting me now.  Just as going to the moon was back in the 60's when I was growing up.  But try to think of something today that was not effected by those challenges that has rewarded our lives.  I think that renewable energy production today brings about those challenges that will bring about benefits for generations to come.  We don't seem to have enough long term goals today, only short term rewards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nancy,Everman,52162,"In 1990 my cousin was visiting from Florida and did not understand ethanol and that she could use it in her vehicle.  When my husband and I explained that this was cleaner, environmental friendly and it supported farmers, her words, ""well then why doesn't everyone use this fuel and I am able to support farmers.""  She used ethanol until she no longer could drive.  Today, as corn growers and users of distillers grain for livestock feeding, we are not only providing fuel and less dependent on foreign oil, we are still feeding 155 people.  Not a bad gig!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terry,Scheffert,50703,"Renewable energy is a key factor in our ability to keep viable resource available for future generations.  Wind and ethanol come to mind right away but here again we must be smart in the use and making of this energy.  granted Iowa has several thousand jobs dedicated to these and provides income as well as helping the economics of the state.  I must confess however  I am puzzled that we walked away from one of the 1st energy sources and that maybe we should explore the advantages of updating the use of hydro once more.  throughout Iowa are waterway that could supply this is handled correctly.  Another renewable resource that we are not currently using to it's fullest is use of vets in the job force.  Since working with vets through the AMVETS Career Center, I find it hard to believe the gap here.  Although Iowa rank high it is still not enough.  Highly skilled and educated workforce is at our doorstep and the work ethics could not be better.  Not to take advantage of these 2 renewable source would not only be wrong, but a slap in the face to our public.

Ethanol has played a big part in this.  While not the total answer to every internal combustion engine, it is a very viable product for the larger majority of newer equipment out there.  The united states and the government has bowed to the petroleumn industry for ages, they laughed at Henry Ford with his work on Soybean products.

Gerald,McGrane,52040,"Honestly, the only thing I can really say is that I have a neighbor that works at the local ethanol plant and I am glad he has a job. What I see since the expansion of ""renewable energy"" is increasing food prices, the decimation of wildlife habitat and poor water quality especially in our interior rivers and streams. If we are going to subsidize corn ethanol we need to set much higher conservation standards. If ethanol and biodiesel are so great then they should be able to stand on their own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

David,Martin,52302,"Working in Iowa as an architect I see how the countryside is affected by policies created elsewhere.  Farming in Iowa is no longer just about raising food.  For too long farmers have counted on the same markets and sources of income.  The alternate energy market, whether it is from wind via generators on their farm ground or alcohol production from the crops they raise, is one way that farmers can diversify their income and remain viable in these times of changing public policy and congressional inaction.  Many say that alcohol production leads to higher food prices.  I question that thought process because the vast portion of our food costs come from the transportation, processing, packaging, marketing, and sale of foods.  Increased crop production for alcohol has simply diversified the market place and stabilized the prices of the corn and other commodities used to make alcohol.  It makes the farmers a partner in our fuel industry, it makes them bigger contributors to our economy, and it keeps our rural areas more viable with fewer people needing assistance.  There is room in our fuel industry for all of the players but it requires a sensible balance of support that rewards innovation to find alternate energy sources and to motivate conservation.  Industries that support the status quo and the depletion of non-renewable natural resources, need to be cut back on governmental support.  Industries that are profitable on their own also need to stand on their own in the marketplace.  The government should reserve support and assistance for innovative and creative ideas that merit further development.  I hope that you will tell them that alternate energy and energy conservation deserve our support because it is the right thing to do for our environment, it is economically sound because it returns to us good jobs and stable citizens, and without it not only Iowa but the entire nation will be worse off for our lack of support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bruce,Bearinger,50662,"In NE Iowa there are multiple ethanol plants. The ethanol industry directly provides many jobs, but that is only part of the story. Epinal increases the value of our farmers corn. With higher value corn, ethanol also provides dollars for farmers to buy goods in our small towns keeping our downtown banks and other industries going. Also farmers buy more machinery, prepaid their inputs at our coops, and can't afford to hire more people for their farming operations. If we end the ethanol production in the Midwest not only will we eliminating jobs, we will be poison in the air with 100% fossil fuels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know the people who went hungry themselves in order to strive to keep their farms, only to loose them in the end.
Please do not repeat this story by scaling back on the RFS. Also, the country needs to get with it as far as being ""green;"" growing a fuel that can be used and yet it regrows the next year and on into the future.","Don't let the farmlands, the farmers and the employed individuals in the Bio-fuel renewable energy jobs become another ""Detroit."" Keep our jobs and keep our state a wonderful place to live. To drive down a country road or a major highway and watch the corn turn beautiful in three seasons is a part of the United States that we want to keep.

The renewable fuels industry has become a significant part of our business, not only because of this use, but because the people who work there are then able to spend money for other areas that impact our business (we supply city drinking water and swimming pool needs too).

Too many US citizens assume that when Iowa corn is turned into ethanol we are throwing food away.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Below is a website that explains what happens to the ""waste"" product of distillation.  There is no waste since the balance of the product is feed for animals. Coming from Iowa you already know this but in case you want to explain it to your Washington colleagues here is a little help.

Deborah,Donohoe,52358,"We are crop farmers. I guess the only point I would make is a lot of farmers including ourselves have invested in pricey farmland and equipment on the assumption that the ethanol mandate would run its course. Further, today's price on corn, ~$4.52/bu., is equivalent to eight cents per pound. How much are people paying for an 18 pound bag of dog food which often primarily consists of ground corn? Or the meat they consume, fed on cheap corn? Why is the price of corn to blame when obviously other factors weigh far more heavily? Ethanol is a fuel technology ""in progress"" and can and will improve but only if given the time and opportunity to do so. If we are going to be energy independent, we need to use our own resources, and that resource is water/land in whatever shape or form. All types of energy have trade-offs, there are no silver bullets at the moment but we will surely never find one if we give up now. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon graduation, I've been employed working within the agricultural supply business and seen first hand the positive impact that renewable fuels have had on the economy of the heartland.  It's created a market that reduces pollution, improves grain prices, and reduces America's dependence on foreign oil. 

A great deal of infrastructure has been created and built to meet the capacity of the capacity of the federal renewable fuels mandate.","Iowa and the heartland states are proud to deliver a product that helps America.  To retreat from this previously approved mandate is wrong and will hurt all of agriculture - America's greatest resource.

Furthermore, I have a 12-year-old car with more than 225,000 miles that has always been driven with ethanol, and despite claims to the contrary, it has run very well.  The ethanol did no harm, and helped it start easily throughout cold winters.  It also helped my pocketbook, so that I could log more miles doing volunteer work and have more money to invest in doing good.

Beyond that, it's my understanding that the leftovers from production of ethanol are then turned into livestock feed.  So the entire value to the food chain is NOT lost when corn is used for fuel.  That's a misleading claim that has drawn too much traction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Darin,Theel,50436,"Bruce,

I am an agricultural loan officer and have been for 24 years.  I have recently been doing annual renewals for farmers and using approx. $4.15 for corn and cash flows are breakeven at best.  In my opinion we are back to normal once again which is ok.  What is not ok is that the creation of the ramping up of the renewable fuels standard has helped to fuel the economy in farming and currently there is really very little or no profit going forward in farming being projected.  Lowering this standard will be devastating to the farming industry.  What has caused our high prices is three years of poor crops or below trend line yields.  This past year finally it came back.  If we get 2 or 3 years of good crops nation wide we will see $3.00 or less corn and there will be devastating results to this.  In my opinion, if we take ethanol production away, we will see an increase in gasoline prices which will hinder our economy again.  I believe high price fuel is what took our economy down last time and this lower priced fuel, if you want to call it lower priced even though it is still higher than two years ago, will help our economy as well as provide jobs in the ethanol industry.  By the way, I was an investor in an ethanol plant and a biodiesel plant, and I have lost 100% of my investment in both as both plants went bankrupt so I believe in ethanol even though this happened to me and I want our nation to not have to depend upon foreign imports for fuel.  This is truly our nations biggest weapon in the world along with food.  We should be a great nation if we can continue to produce both food and fuel and not have to import only when economically feasible.  As a tax payer I don't necessarily want to subsidize things but I think the facts need to be given about the return on our investments from subsidies like labor creation and tax dollars generated.

This is even before we add in the economic impact of the extra value of the corn and soybeans local farmers grew and sold to make these renewable fuels or the impact of the local jobs created..

David,Kuhn,52205,"Why would they scale back the requirements.  I thought the main reason to use renewable energy was to discover alternatives to oil and protect the environment.  Have those goal's changed in the last few years?  We need to become energy independent from all the countries that supply us with oil.  Then they cannot control us and decisions on foreign affairs that we make just because we need their oil.

Keep the regulations in place and continue the research to find new technology and keep the farmers earning a good income.  When the farmer makes money they will spend it Iowa and keep our state growing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bonnie,Williams,52401,"Dear Bruce,

I grew up on a farm in Allamakee County.  My sister and I now co-own that farm and rent it to a tenant who has farmed it for many years.  Any change that would impact prices of crops would impact our income and our livelihood.  More important than it impacting our income, it would impact the income of every farmer in Iowa in one way or another.  And the ripple effect would continue into all agricultural and food-related businesses, which in turn would impact the economy of the entire state.  

Additionally, I believe in promoting renewable energy and decreasing our reliance on fossil fuels.  Until we fully harness the power of sun, wind, water, and other renewable fuel sources, we will continue to damage our environment and leave the world less safe for future generations.  Fracking seems to be rampant in our country.  The damage that it can do to aquifers could ruin our water supplies for generations to come.  People and animals are falling ill, both from the mining of the sand used in fracking and from the horrific damage to water supplies caused by the fracking.  It seems only prudent and reasonable that our government would do everything in its power to stop the gas/oil companies from devastating our environment and to support the development of renewable energy sources.  

Thank you for caring about all of us in Iowa.

Sincerely,
Bonnie Williams",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Todd,Janus,50312,"I have noticed over the last few years that renewable energy has been a drag on the economy. I know that it has increased water usage and the use of ethanol for cars has increased the cost of food for the poor in Iowa. Plus the energy consumed to make a gallon of ethanol is more than the energy contained within that gallon. Adding the trouble with diesel transportation of the ethanol and the cost is a burden to the poor in our mist and increases global warming. Wind energy has seen the killing of many birds. Indeed the Justice department is not suing some wind energy firms for the tragic death of our american bird - the bald eagle.
I am pleased that Obama has approved and encouraged fracking and the cultivation of petroleum, making us the number one energy producer in the nation.
The EPA continues to promote policies that are detrimental to the citizens for whom they should be working, not working against. I am appalled and saddened that the main purpose and goal of the EPA through the leadership command has so aggressively tried to destroy what is good about Iowa and the USA. I look forward to the time when Congress stops the pillaging of our natural resources as done by the EPA. I am certain Mr Braley will be at the forefront of this project when he becomes a Senator next year.",I look forward to your sharing my comments with the committee and the EPA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dennis,Ewing,50010,"The question in my mind is “does it make any sense whatsoever to send all our money and weapon buying capability to those countries that HATE America in exchange oil or would it make more sense to support a homegrown and renewable US-based fuel source?  For those who don’t like the idea of funding countries or groups who hate America, maybe we should reexamine the inherent wisdom in effort to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil. Consider the FACT that ethanol produces fewer harmful emissions than regular gasoline, a drastic reduction in hydrocarbon emissions, less volatile compounds and reduced oxides of sulfur. Sound science illustrates that the carbon released during combustion is actually recycled back into new plants being grown to produce more ethanol as part of the carbon cycle. Gasoline has a negative energy balance of around 14% which is referred to as an embedded cost in the petroleum industry. Functionally, this means that 18 ounces of gasoline must be consumed for each gallon of gasoline produced. By contrast, solid scientific research has documented the fact that ethanol provides a positive energy balance ranging between 5% to 35% depending on system of production. The net result is that ethanol contains more energy than is required to produce it due to the fact that the bulk of the energy required to grow the plants is provided by the sun. Unless you are funded by big oil or hate America, it seems to make good sense to promote and support ethanol, improve U.S. energy security and reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
Beyond the self-deprecating direct negative economic impact on the ethanol industry itself, let’s give some consideration to the impact on agriculture and the economy overall.  Corn commodity prices have already fallen so far they are BELOW the cost of production. As a consequence, scaling back the Renewable Fuels Standard would deliver a severe blow to a tax revenues, agricultural manufacturing, employment and all sectors of the economy benefiting from farm income expenditures. The United States posted a trade surplus of $38.5 billion and taxable net farm income totaled $112.8 billion in 2012. Each $1 billion of agricultural exports supported 6,800 American jobs.  At some point this administration needs to start thinking what is good for America. Why should we intentionally engage in actions destined to increase bankruptcies, weaken financial institutions and undermine America?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gary,Kroshus,52101,"My wife and I live on the family farm homesteaded in 1914, we nearly lost it in  the early 80's when loans were 17% and corn sold for less than $2.00 a bushel and beans $5.00. I realize everything has changed and one of the best is renewable fuels for Iowa and across the country I don't think a lot of Americans really know what this is saving them every time they go to the gas or fuel pumps. We have to get away from the hold big oil  has on us how much profit do they need? Also President Obama pushed renewable fuels on his 2012 campaign and now he's going to back down to big oil. I thought the EPA was for clean air have they been bought off be big oil also? Let's keep renewable fuel going.

As the Dean of the medical school at Des Moines University, one of the focus areas for our college is Global Health. The health impacts due to climate change are steadily growing; from viral encephalitis and West Nile from mosquitos, to Malaria, to nature disasters. Renewable energy is not only good for Iowa and the environment, but is paramount in order to prevent a catastrophic course and impact on health and healthcare around the world. The statistics due not lie. The amount of lung disease in China with the smog, the amount of malaria in Southeast Africa, the numbers of deaths of folks due to the escalating toll of climate change continues to mount. Only by continuing cleaner renewable energy and continuing to add support to the agricultural","base that supports it, will this ever have a chance of changing. 

It is not only an economic issue, a way of life in Iowa, but also one more piece in a greater puzzle that will help stem the impacts of climate change. The President has made this a center point of his administration (http://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change) and thus the EPA's non-support of this lower emission renewable energy source is not congruent with that position.

Thank you for asking for input in this matter that certainly has implications today and for generations in the future. Renewable clean energy is our future.

If we do need to trim the fat on energy subsidies, we should cut subsidies to energy production that harms the environment, big oil, before we go after the clean solutions of the future.

Now they have been purchased by people who did so well during the hog market days of the 1970s, when prices were so high, and farmers who sold cattle could not make it. So many farms houses have been burned down for farm land, the fence lines have been removed to give the farmer about another 2 to 4 rows of corn or soybeans nearer to the road. Most farmers live off the land by having large gardens because they don't make that much money anymore since prices for grain and cattle and hogs are so low.

Marc,Rauch,52401,"Engine fuel and energy technology doesn't just power automobiles, it powers our entire economy. No, I take that back, it powers the world’s economy. 

The automobile industry is the world's largest and most important industry. If we, the people in all democratic countries, can find a new and better way to fuel vehicles; something that saves money, and keeps the money in the domestic “purses” of each country, then it gives everyone in that country a boost. If we can find renewable alternative energy sources that don’t damage the environment then we’re all healthier and happier. And if we can find alternatives that can’t be used as strategic weapons by one country against another then we have a freer global society. And if we can do all of this then people buy more cars and trucks, which increases job opportunities, corporate revenues, taxes, and enjoyment of life.

The bottom line is that I support all alternative fuels; particularly those that we can produce here in America from American raw materials. I love CNG, I love propane, and I love algae-based bio-fuels. But I especially love ethanol because it can be produced from so many different types of abundant raw materials right now, today, and the use of ethanol doesn’t have to require any costly engine conversion. Depending upon your vehicle you can put a rather high percentage of ethanol in your fuel tank right now. And the only effect you will experience is that you will save money – up to $1.00 or more on every gallon of ethanol you use.

I also love the idea of electric vehicles, but I’m very skeptical of electric's potential to help us out of our present economic depression. Electric cars may just not be a significant factor until the end of this century, the 21st century. That means that not only will we be dead and buried by the time of an electric vehicle revolution, but our children (if they are above the age of puberty) may not see it either. I feel that electric gets the support it does from the gasoline companies because the gasoline companies know that electric isn’t a real threat. They use electric as a carrot before the mule: “Just keep on using gasoline; we’ll get to that there electric soon enough.” But soon never comes.

In any event, what this all gets down to is building new factories, putting people to work, creating new supportive businesses and putting people to work in them; and keeping the money here to be used to buy more domestic products that are built by our own citizens. The petroleum oil and gasoline industry just sucks us dry.

Mark,McWilliams,52205,"6 months ago I retired after 30 years with SCS-NRCS in Jones County.  I made a lot of friends with the farmers who depend on the income that is generated from corn sales for ethanol production.  Almost all of the beef feeders use distillers grain in their feed rations.  Reducing ethanol use would hurt their incomes and disrupt their feeding operations.  Less corn production will mean more soybeans will be planted in the hills, causing more erosion. Beans loosen the soil and don't produce enough residue to protect the soil.  But I am opposed to using corn stover for cellulosic ethanol.  That will expose the soil to more erosion and deplete organic matter in the soil.  I guess you can say that I an all for grain ethanol and against cellulosic ethanol.

I burn 10% ethanol in all of my on-road vehicles.  They run well on it and we never have any problems with gas lines freezing in the coldest winters.

 With our nation producing a record corn crop this is certainly the time to keep the RFS goals in place and definitely not the time to be reducing them.  In the past 12 months the price of corn for December, 2013 has dropped from $6.45 per bushel to $4.25 per bushel...a drop of 34%.  The market is obviously working very well without any interference from the EPA.

Jake,Baldwin,52057,"I would like to thank you for your time.
 The ethanol industry has been the best tool I have had since starting farming. Without this opportunity there would be less farmers. We are the most efficient group of people you will find in this great country. We produced one of the largest corn crops in history. With almost a 2 billion bushel carry over from this extraordinary crop. How can you even consider reducing this mandate? The cost of producing this crop for 2013 is about $5.20 per bushel. Today I could sell my corn for $4.42. When you do the math, it doesn’t work. Lowering ethanol production would only make this gap wider.
  Nothing makes me happier to drive by a gas station and see the price of gas. Regular gas is .20 cents a gallon higher than E 10 gas. I did my job- well! Less foreign oil. That is what this was designed to do.
 I know of no farmer abusing the land to produce corn. This kind of farming is far in the past.  You have to be good and produce more for less. We make less trips across the field and use far less fertilizer than ever before.
 I am also a Seed Advisor for Syngenta. We now are raising corn called Enogen. This corn has a breakthrough technology for increasing the productivity of dry grind ethanol plants. This means they can produce more ethanol using less water, electricity and natural gas. 
 I don’t know if you remember what the 80s were like, but changing this mandate would start us back down that road of corn carryovers bushels never seen before. Personally I don’t know why this is not being raised to E 15.  
I am proud to help feed and fuel this country.

This action by the EPA would not only hurt us personally in Scott County. That is only the tip of the iceberg.

My name is Matt Kauffman and I work for Key Cooperative as a location manager in Newton, Iowa.  The position I currently hold was created a little over three years ago as a direct result of the RFS legislation and gave me the opportunity to return to the state of Iowa where I grew up.  The cooperative that I work for made the decision to build a new state of the art rail facility on the Iowa Interstate Railroad to meet the growing demand of corn shipments to ethanol plants on this particular railroad.  To date we have invested approximately $5.5 million in this facility, and gave local producers an additional marketing opportunity in Newton and surrounding areas.  This facility averages around 40, 25 car units per year of corn all of which have went to ethanol plants in Iowa, and Illinois.  This facility has been a significant investment for the cooperative and we have seen tremendous growth at this facility and has provide jobs in Iowa both in construction as well as staff needed to run this location.  Our most recent project we found a manufacturer that fabricates all of the grain handling equipment in Nevada, Iowa that just recently opened.  The company as well opened to meet the demand of grain elevators expanding to meet the demand created from ethanol plants.  Before RFS, Iowa had a glut of corn that had to be shipped out of state to be consumed.  Now we are able to process much of the corn in Iowa creating fuel and animal feed as well as providing good jobs to local Iowans.  The ethanol plants that have been built in Iowa over the past 6-7 years have had such a far reaching affect to the local economy.

Last time I picked up a newspaper the foreign countries that supply oil to us weren't all that stable or friendly to the US. When a minister in Florida can threaten to burn a pile of books and cause an international incident, now might not be the time to cut back on alternative fuel sources. 
Another thing to take note of is the decline in the number of oil refineries in the US compared to the number of ethanol plants in the US.

This is a subjective nut to crack in terms of big picture national benefit..   As I understand the calculus:  
The costs of more corn ethanol (environmental, climate, water, energy return, etc) does not outweigh the benefits of more biofuels - where fuel consumption demand is now projecting to be lowering – (can’t support blending higher than E10 – thus the reduction)   

This may well be oil industry lobby vs. corn/farming industry lobby rhetoric – Would love to know the real “truth” behind all of this in terms of what “really” is our most beneficial RFS (ethanol) policy for the country as a whole – and not just for a subsidized boost to targeted regional economy. (akin to lobbying for keeping military bases and defense projects)  

But in the end, I know Iowa always seems to get the short end of the stick economically in terms of U.S. “growth” programs --  Iowa can’t afford to lose jobs and revenue.

Dennis,Strayer,50643,"Farmers have had to deal with the unknown because of the lack of a government farm program or the late passage of programs for many years.  Now another government agency threatens to affect their livelihoods.  Agriculture is working hard to provide high quality food, fiber, feed, and now fuel.  Look at the progress in the efficiency of bio-fuel production, both in the production of feed-stocks and in the production of fuels themselves.  Once a government program is established, especially when it affects long-term decisions like building fuel production plants, the program should be left as is unless there is a clear need for a change.  This need is only driven by fossil fuel industries.","Production agriculture (farming) and related industries in agricultural value chains require a much longer production planning period than most industries.  In the U.S. crop production areas only one crop is produced each year therefore planning needs to be done in the year prior to the growing year.  Most other industries may decide to produce a product, plan production, and then produce for as long as there is demand for that product.  Outside influences don't affect their production.  Agriculture is affected by weather, world markets, and government programs.  Weather can't be controlled.  World markets can be observed and taken into consideration for production planning.  Government programs, if established far enough in advance, can be part of the planning process.  When a government program, such as the RFS, is changed during the production cycle it has a major affect on financial outcomes.  Related to the RFS an entire industry (alternative fuels) was built around the established guidelines.  To pull the rug out now would be disastrous to corn and soybean farmers and the alternative fuel industry.

Eric,Moellers,50613,"Hello Congressman Braley,

Thank you for your interest in the opinion of Iowans.

First of all, at the very least, the RFS should be held at the current level.

Whether or not to increase the RFS as we head into the future depends on the answer to several questions. I do not have the answers to these questions, but perhaps you do.

Is there enough ethanol and biodiesel to meet RFS demands? Perhaps the goals set back in '05 and '07 were too ambitious.

If we can't currently meet RFS demands, what changes would be necessary to meet those demands? Does an increase in supply rely on advances in technology? For example, must corn yield increase or ethanol plants become more efficient? What technology appears to be on the horizon? Has the RFS been an incentive for technological ingenuity in the past? An increase in supply could also come about if farmers began tilling up CRP land or land adjacent to our rivers. The environmental cost of those practices could outweigh the income made by selling that corn.

If the RFS is held at its current pace instead of being allowed to grow, does that mean renewable fuels will be unable to surpass RFS goals? In other words, just because the RFS mandates a minimum of say a 15% ethanol mix, is it possible the free market will demand a 25% ethanol mix? Are consumers conscious enough to make that choice on their own or does it need to be a government directive? Will I bring my own bag to the grocery store or does it need to made law (like in Los Angeles).

If the RFS goals set in '05 and '07 were too ambitious, perhaps it is time to concede that we are unable to meet those goals. Keep in mind that a similar admission may be necessary when the goals set for minimum MPG for our vehicles come about. I believe the goal is 50+ mpg by 2025? 

On the other hand, what if we had admitted that we were not quite ready to go to the moon in 1969?

It doesn't create as many jobs as speculated, it is subject to ecologic disasters in pipeline failure, and leaves a huge disposal cleanup in Texas.

The power grid transmission system needs vast improvement to send wind energy to high usage centers.  There is one being touted right now cutting across Iowa into Illinois that is receiving a lot of negativity on its route and construction.  This NIMBY reaction is unsound.

Also, fracking has questionable practices and its impact on the environment isn't entirely healthy. Growing corn? Seems pretty healthy to me -- at least we know what impact it has on the environment.

My cousin works for the National Renewable Energy Lab in Colorado. Below are his comments about renewable energy.

His comments are in the ""additional comments"" box.","Bruce Braley is a Democrat so he should be receptive to what is good for his
state versus that ass Steve King who would vote for drought and locusts if
it pleased his Tea Party masters. 

Iowa is a leader in renewable fuel production so it is very good for the
Hawkeye State's economy. Before ethanol took off in the mid-2000's  corn
prices languished around $2 per bushel for decades.  Ten years ago corn
furnaces were marketed because it was cheaper to burn corn than wood pellets
or propane. Farming was losing its financial viability and rural communities
steadily declined. 

Concerns that ethanol causes food costs to rise are unfounded, as Iowa
farmers have ramped up production and corn prices have fallen dramatically
with the 2013 harvest.  

Ethanol uses only the starch portion of corn; the remaining protein is used
for livestock feed, so corn is getting double use and adding more value than
when it was used strictly for feed. 

Iowa is home to one of the country's first cellulosic ethanol plants that
will make fuel out of corn stalks, not grain. Cellulosic ethanol is so
important that President George W. Bush mentioned it prominently in his 2005
State of the Union address.

I support the RFS because I support American farmers, American industry and therefore support ethanol, America's homegrown fuel. 

It takes over 40 gallons of water to distill one gallon of gasoline. It takes less than 3 gallons of water to distill one gallon of ethanol. Many American ethanol plants are working to convert to 0% discharge plants, how can we not support them? Ethanol is cleaner, better for the environment and a better use of our natural resources. 

In addition to the local economic benefits of this policy, the RFS is necessary to ensure Americans have the right to cheaper, cleaner, homegrown renewable fuels. The oil industry s monopoly on the liquid fuels market has gone on far too long.

A recent Fuels America poll shows our nation s overwhelming support for renewable fuels:

As an ethanol producer, I am writing you with deep concern regarding the recent proposed rule for the 2014 Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) as required as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

The impact that the RFS has had on ethanol plants and production cannot be overstated. Since its original enactment in 2005, I have witnessed firsthand the positive impact it has had on my local economy and the plant that I work at. In fact, it was directly due to the RFS that I have a job at our plant today. As the RFS helped drive the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol, the demand for production grew and I was able to seize on the opportunity to work right here in my hometown for a good, solid wage, doing honorable work that helps me support myself, my family and my country s growing energy needs.

The bottom line is that this proposal would have a devastating ripple effect on ethanol plants, their production and the jobs they support   as well as the surrounding communities. With less money, there is a smaller tax base   our schools, hospital and local municipal services will suffer. I could very well lose my job and in a time of economic uncertainty we need to capitalize on the opportunities, such as biofuel production to keep America, and our rural economy strong. This is not an exaggeration, it is the reality.

As you move forward in putting together a final rule, I hope you will consider the fallout if a rule, such as the one proposed would have on ethanol plants and the workers who count on their jobs at these facilities around the country.

I am writing in support of keeping the 2014 Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) under the RFS intact and I hope you consider my comments when making your determination.

I along with 82 percent of Americans want to have a choice and savings at the pump. I believe American-made ethanol can make a difference in the nation s economy by keeping hard-earned American dollars here at home. 

I am tired of reading about the record profits of oil companies quarter after quarter. Just recently, it was reported that the five biggest oil companies reported $23 billion in combined profits for their third quarter of 2013. The $175,000 per minute they earn is more in one minute than 95 percent of Americans earn in a year. Enough is enough, especially when I am spending more at the pump. Were it not for renewable fuels, I d pay even more. I wholeheartedly support the RFS.

As an American citizen, I care about the environment, and the energy and national security of my country for my generation and generations to come.

After years of success from the RFS, we must not move backward. We must capitalize on the current success and continue to invest in the future development and commercial scale production of next generation biofuels. A rule such as this would only halt any further innovation, investment and growth in what is already a successful and thriving industry that supports Americans.

This policy is making America stronger. We cannot afford to turn our backs on such a successful policy.

Supporting the RFS is critical for America and the future of our nation. I thank you for your consideration.

Donald,Harmon,52205,"Bruce, I support you in your stand on keeping the RFS as is. We need to 
protect our workers, farmers and affordable fuel for our vehicles. Ask them 
what this change will due to protect our economy or even improve it. We 
do not need to be constantly working to change things that don't present us 
any problems. By the way it also protects our environment. Best wishes 
and thank you for your representation.

As an ethanol producer, I am writing you with deep concern regarding the recent proposed rule for the 2014 Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) as required as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

The impact that the RFS has had on ethanol plants and production cannot be overstated. Since its original enactment in 2005, I have witnessed firsthand the positive impact it has had on my local economy and the plant that I work at. In fact, it was directly due to the RFS that I have a job at our plant today. As the RFS helped drive the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol, the demand for production grew and I was able to seize on the opportunity to work right here in my hometown for a good, solid wage, doing honorable work that helps me support myself, my family and my country s growing energy needs.

The bottom line is that this proposal would have a devastating ripple effect on ethanol plants, their production and the jobs they support   as well as the surrounding communities. With less money, there is a smaller tax base   our schools, hospital and local municipal services will suffer. I could very well lose my job and in a time of economic uncertainty we need to capitalize on the opportunities, such as biofuel production to keep America, and our rural economy strong. This is not an exaggeration, it is the reality.

As you move forward in putting together a final rule, I hope you will consider the fallout if a rule, such as the one proposed would have on ethanol plants and the workers who count on their jobs at these facilities around the country.

Patricia,McGee,52240,"Dear Representative Braley,



I would first ask the EPA why a department that is called the Environmental
Protection Agency is not protecting the environment. Somehow they are
listening to big oil and turning their backs on the environment. It is a
shame that the EPA has to be sued by private citizens to get them to do
their job. By raising the standards for the amount of ethanol our fuel
contains, they will produce a cleaner environment. They should be instead
be requiring E15 in our fuel rather than lowering the standard as they
propose. It is about time that the EPA does its job or they should be sent
packing and new people should be appointed to their positions.

As a veteran concerned with our security and the strategic value of alternative fuels I am writing in support of keeping the 2014 Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) under the RFS intact and I hope you consider my comments when making your determination.

Over the last 40 years we have experienced price shock after price shock due to unrest and instability in the Middle-East. Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Iran, Syria   all unstable oil producing nations in a region where the slightest disruptions can have a drastic ripple effect on the supply and price of oil.

Wars have been fought; trillions of dollars have been spent to protect the flow of oil, and trillions more of our wealth has been transferred to foreign nations. But most important, the precious lives of American soldiers have been lost due to our addiction to foreign oil.
After years of success from the RFS, we must not move backward.

We must capitalize on the current success and continue to invest in the future development and commercial scale production of next generation biofuels. A rule such as this would only halt any further innovation, investment and growth in what is already a successful and thriving industry that supports Americans.

i sincerely hope my elected officials, as well as appointed agency heads, will represent me, the consumer, a veteran, and tax-paying American, to move our country forward, by generating home-grown energy, and transitioning to an energy policy that reduces our need for wars, and also reduces our carbon footprint. Please, represent me.

This policy is making America stronger. We cannot afford to turn our backs on such a successful policy.

Supporting the RFS is critical for America and the future of our nation. I thank you for your consideration.

Matthew,Havel,52132,"I like ethanol blended gasoline because it keep everything cleaner. Ethanol being slightly corrosive it keep every ones fuel system that uses it cleaner and free from gunk formed in fuel systems from pure petroleum fuels. Ethanol burns cleaner producing less smog this is especially important in more urban areas. Especially with this cold winter this year ethanol works as a fuel line antifreeze without buy a bottle of ""heat"" every fill up. In the summer on the other hand ethanol burns cooler than pure gasoline. Another thing some opponents say pure gasoline gets better fuel mileage so we are better off not using it. Well my owners manual for my car recommends ethanol blended gasoline and gets better fuel mileage than the EPA suggests it gets new and its ten years old!","Remind them with renewable fuels we are only taking the liquid out of the seeds and the dry part can still be used for feed. Ethanol and bio-diesel factories have no waist products only co-products for example dry ice comes from ethanol factories. Also we have surpassed the maximum amount of fuel that can from a corn as suggested by experts less than ten years ago cutting funding to renewable fuels would cripple these leaps and bounds bio-fuels have made in the last ten years. 

Keep up the good work fighting for renewable fuels!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
